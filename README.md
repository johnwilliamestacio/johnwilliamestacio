## About Me

IT professional with 5+ years of experience, now focused on **cybersecurity operations**—specifically **threat detection**, **incident response**, and **digital forensics**.

I believe security isn't just about technology—it's about people. That's why I spend time teaching digital literacy to senior citizens and raising cybersecurity awareness in communities that need it most.

## Note

Cybersecurity isn't just a career—it's where I found both challenge and purpose.

I'm continuously building, learning, and defending systems and people.

*"Watching 70+ year-olds light up when they successfully sent their first email to their grandchildren reminded me why I love what I do."*
